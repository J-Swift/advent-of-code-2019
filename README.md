These are my solutions to the AOC 2019 puzzles. They are not refactored and so they represent what I submitted, with maybe some cleanup to remove noisy debug code used during local testing.

Most days/phases are copy-pasted from previous ones and so there will be (seemingly) weird code choices due to that.

That said, let me know if you have any pointers!
